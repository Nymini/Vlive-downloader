## Summary
A program that, given a bunch of VLIVE video URLs, downloads them in the requested video quality + subtitles.

## To Do List
- Improved UI
- Support to load videos from a .txt files
- Preferences. E.g. Always download English subtitles if available

## Usage
Simply paste in a valid vlive video URL, and choose a video resolution (subtitles optional), and click download.
Note that only VODs can be downloaded from Vlive.

## Credits
Credits to polaris9017 who has a similar program here: https://github.com/polaris9017/vdl.
Without their program, I wouldn't have figured out how to make the neccessary API calls to retrieve the video informations + links.
